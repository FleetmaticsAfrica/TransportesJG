<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>If you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the <a href="https://transportjg.org/support/forums/">Support Forums</a>.</li>
	<li>WordPress has a robust plugin <abbr>API</abbr> (Application Programming Interface) that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/">Plugin Developer Handbook</a>. You shouldn&#8217;t modify any of the core code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Share the Love</h2>
<p>WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better&#8212;you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgeable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.</p>

<p>WordPress is the official continuation of <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2/caf&#233;log</a>, which came from Michel V. The work has been continued by the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/">WordPress developers</a>.
